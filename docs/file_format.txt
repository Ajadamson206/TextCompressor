File header: (Encoding the key into the binary file)

8 bits to represent the maximum level reached by the huffman tree
1's and 0's representing the huffman tree. 
    1 -> node exists. 0 -> node does not exist.

Treat the binary like it is a complete binary tree represented by an array

Demo header:
    00000011 11111000 (An extra 0 was added to extend tree to the full 8 bits) -> 3 Node Node Node Node Node NULL NULL NULL 
    
Nodes with no children will have a character placed there signifying the end of the encoding

After the tree binary is represented the characters that will be found in the tree starting from the left will be added.
