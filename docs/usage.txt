Usage Examples:

Encoding with built in key: ./Compressor -e File1.txt File2.txt File3.txt ...
Decoding with built in key: ./Compressor -d File1.hc File2.hc File3.hc ...

Options:
    Encoding:
        --encode
        -e Encode files with this particular algorithm 
            ./Compressor -e File1.txt
        
        --separate
        -s Separate the key file from the outputted .hc file
            ./Compressor -e -s File1.txt File2.txt -> You will get 2 key files

        --merge
        -m Merge multiple file keys into a single larger key
            ./Compressor -e -m File1.txt File2.txt -> Each file header may contain unnecessary key information
            ./Compressor -e -m -s File1.txt File2.txt -> Output a single key file that can be used on both .hc files
    
    Decoding:
        --decode
        -d Decode files
            ./Compressor -d File2.hc
        
        --key
        -k Specify the location of the key file if it is not built into the file
            ./Compressor -d -k hc_key.key File2.hc File3.h
    
    Other:
        --help
        -h print help menu

        --extract 
        -x Extract the key in the file header from the already encoded file
            ./Compressor -x File1.hc File2.hc -> Will output 4 files 2 will be .hc files without the key header and 2 will be key files

        --threads
        -t Specify number of threads to be used -> Each thread will work on a different file
            ./Compressor -e File1.txt File2.txt -t 3 -> Only two threads will be used

        --verbose Enable console logging
